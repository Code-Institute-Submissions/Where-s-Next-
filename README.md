**Testing User Stories**

**External User Goals:**
* Find the best holiday destination for their needs.

    The website uses Google Maps, Google Places and radio buttons to allow the user to [search](assets/images/search.png)
    for their best destination.

**Site Owner's Goals:**
*  Get users to choose a travel package from this site and/or from its sponsors.

    An [inspire me](assets/images/destinations.png) section was added to inspire users to choose a travel package, 
    the info-window allows the users to click on the [hyperlink](assets/images/hyperlink.png) and can see prices and booking details. 

*  Allow users to select/search a city and see a map showing attractions, accommodation & restaurants.

    The user can utilise the [country](assets/images/country.png) and/or the [city](assets/images/city.png) to select their 
    destination. Then using the radio buttons they can filter between hotels, restaurants and things to do.

*  Display results that are visually appealing and user friendly.

    Multiple markers drop onto the map and provide user with location of the places. A [results](assets/images/results.png) 
    table matches the marker with the name of the place found and an info window pops up when marker clicked.



## Bugs

*  When the reset button is clicked the map, country and city retuns to original state but the radio buttons don't reset.
This has been left unfixed as the user can toggle between the radio buttons when next city is selected.
